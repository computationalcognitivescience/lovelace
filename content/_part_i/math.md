We saw in the [Introduction](https://computationalcognitivescience.github.io/lovelace/part_i/intro) that, just like sculpting, theoretical modeling requires its own set of dedicated tools. The theoretical modeler's toolbox includes a.o. mathematical concepts, formal expressions, and notational conventions. One can already get quite far with the basics in _set theory_, _functions_ and _logic_. Below we present a brief primer. Readers who have taken introductory classes on these topics can skip this section without loss of continuity. If, however, these materials are new to you, then we recommend carefully studying this chapter before proceeding. A good grasp of the concepts and notation defined here will be necessary for following the examples and exercises in subsequent chapters. In general, developing some fluency in mathematical language is key if one wants to become a theoretical modeler.

## Set theory
{% marginfigure "fig-set-eg" "assets/img/set-eg.svg" "Sets can be visualized as circles." %}
A set is a collection of distinct objects. For example, a set of people $$P=\{\text{Ramiro},\text{Brenda},\text{Molly}\}$$, animals $$A=\{\text{cat},\text{turtle},\text{blue whale}, \text{cuttlefish}\}$$ or numbers $$ N=\{1,5,7,12\}$$. Sets are usually denoted by a capital letter and their elements listed between curly brackets. They can also be visualized as circles.

Sets can contain an infinite number of objects, e.g. all positive odd numbers $$O=\{1,3,5, 7,\dots\}$$.

### Set membership
When we want to write that an object $$x$$ is (or is not) part of a set $$X$$, we use _set membership_ notation:

{% marginfigure "fig-set-in" "assets/img/set-in.svg" "Set membership."%}

$$5 \in N\\17 \notin N\\\text{Ramiro}\in P\\\text{Saki}\notin P$$


### Subset and superset
{% marginfigure fig-subset "assets/img/set-sub.svg" "Subset relationship." %}
Often, we want to express things like 'the set of mammals $$M$$ is part of the set of all animals $$A$$'. We then use _subset_ notation: $$M\subseteq A$$ or $$M\subset A$$. The latter means that $$M$$ is smaller than $$A$$.

{% marginfigure fig-superset "assets/img/set-sup.svg" "Superset relationship." %}
Vice versa, we can express that 'the set of all things on earth $$T$$ contains all animals $$A$$' using _superset_ notation: $$T\supseteq A$$ or $$T\supset A$$. The latter means that $$T$$ is bigger than $$A$$.



### Intersection, union and difference
Let's look at what more we can do with two sets.
{% marginfigure fig-set-two "assets/img/set-two.svg" "Example sets." %}
For example, take the set of your friends and my friends.

$$F_{you}=\{\text{John},\text{Roberto},\text{Holly},\text{Doris},\text{Charlene}\}$$

$$F_{me}=\{\text{Vicky},\text{Charlene},\text{Ramiro},\text{Johnnie},\text{Roberto}\}$$


{% marginfigure fig-set-intersection "assets/img/set-intersection.png" "Set intersection." %}
Who are our common friends? We use _set intersection_:

$$F_{you}\cap F_{me} = \{\text{Roberto},\text{Charlene}\}$$



Who do we know together? We use _set union_:

$$F_{you}\cup F_{me} = \{\text{John},\text{Roberto},\text{Holly},\text{Doris},\text{Charlene},$$ $$\text{Vicky},$$ $$\text{Ramiro},$$ $$\text{Johnnie}\}$$

{% marginfigure fig-set-union "assets/img/set-union.svg" "Set union." %}

Who do I know that you do not know? We use _set difference_:

$$F_{me}\setminus F_{you}=\{\text{Vicky},\text{Ramiro},\text{Johnnie}\}$$

{% marginfigure fig-set-difference "assets/img/set-minus.svg" "Set difference." %}

### Set builder
A more advanced way to denote sets, is to define a set using _set builder_ notation. This allows us to define (build) a new set given other set(s). A set builder consists of two parts, a variable and a logical predicate:

$$\{\text{variable}~|~\text{predicate}\}$$

Let's look at an example and build a set of all mammals from $A$. We explain logical predicates below, for now lets use verbal language:

$$M=\{a~|~a\in A\text{ and }a\text{ is a mammal}\}$$

You can read this as '$$M$$ contains all $$a$$'s _with the property that_ $$a\in A$$ and $$a$$ is a mammal'.

{% marginfigure fig-set-builder "assets/img/set-builder.svg" "Set builder." %}

### Cardinal product
Set builder notation is useful to filter objects from a single set, but becomes very potent when building from multiple sets. For example:

$$F=\{(p,a)~|~p\in P\text{ AND }a\in A\}$$

{% marginfigure fig-cardinal-product "assets/img/set-cardinal.svg" "Cardinal product." %}

Read this as '$$F$$ contains all pairs of $$p$$ and $$a$$ _with the property that_ $$p$$ is a person and $$a$$ is an animal'. Pairs are denoted in brackets. You can think of $$F$$ containing all possible combinations of person-animal pairs. For example, these are all the options you have when trying to guess what the favorite animals are of your friends.

Many other set builders are possible too, but this specific 'pair builder' is called the _cardinal product_ of two sets. It is used often enough that it has its own special symbol: $$F=P\times A$$.

### Special sets
Finally, there are some special sets which we often use that have their own symbols:


* Empty set $$\varnothing=\{\}$$
* Natural (whole) numbers (with zero) $$\mathbb{N}_0=\{0,1,2,3,4,\dots\}$$
* Natural (whole) numbers (without zero) $$\mathbb{N}^*=\{1,2,3,4,\dots\}$$
* Integer numbers $$\mathbb{Z}=\{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots\}$$
* Real numbers <span>$$\mathbb{R}=\{r~|~-\infty<r<\infty\}$$</span>

## Functions
Building on set theory, we can define functions. Functions are relations that map all objects from one set (the _domain_) to exactly one object from another set (the _codomain_). We define functions with the following notation, here $$f$$ is the name of the function:


$$f:D \rightarrow C\text{ with }f(d)=c$$

Let's make this more concrete:

$$like: P \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$$

You can read this as '$$like$$ is a function that maps persons $$p\in P$$ to an integer'.

{% marginfigure fig-function "assets/img/fun-basic.svg" "Function." %}

We sometimes omit the exact specification of the function when it is clear what it would be. For example, here it could be a list of numbers representing how much you (dis)like the person, based on your social interactions with that person.

### Advanced functions
We can also give functions more complex domains by using set theory. What would a function that captures how much two persons like each other look like?

$$like_2:P\times P\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$$

The cardinal product $$P\times P$$ denotes all pairs of persons and $$like_2$$ maps pairs to an integer.

{% marginfigure fig-advanced-function "assets/img/fun-adv.svg" "Advanced function." %}


### Sum and product
We can now define _summation_ and _product_. These functions iterate over members in a set and return a summary value.

Summation $$\sum$$ takes all $$x$$'s from $$X$$, applies $$f(x)$$ to each and adds all values:

$$\sum_{x\in X}f(x)=f(x_1)+f(x_2)+f(x_3)+\dots$$

Product takes $\prod$ all $x$'s from $$X$$, applies $$f(x)$$ to each and multiplies all values:

$$\prod_{x\in X}f(x)=f(x_1)f(x_2)f(x_3)\dots$$

## Logic
Logical predicates can be thought of as a special type of function that returns a Boolean value true ($$\text{true}$$ or $$\top$$) or false ($$\text{false}$$ or $$\bot$$). Predicates can be thought of as asking or claiming whether or not a statement is true or false.

For example, is $$x$$ bigger than $$2$$? Is $$a$$ a mammal and small? Is Emily your friend? Or, $$x$$ is bigger than $$2$$, $$a$$ is a mammal and small, and Emily is my friend.

Let's introduce some formal notation to express these statements:

* _number comparisons_ are familiar to most $$<$$, $$\leq$$, $$>$$, $$\geq$$, $$=$$, and $$\neq$$
* _conjunctions_ (logical $$\text{AND}$$) $$p\wedge q$$ is $$\top$$ if and only if both $$p=\top$$ and $$q=\top$$
* _disjunctions_ (logical $$\text{OR}$$) $$p\vee q$$ is $$\top$$ if $$p=\top$$ or if $$q=\top$$
* _set membership_ can also be used as a predicate $$a\in A$$ is $$\top$$ if $$a$$ is a member of set $$A$$

### Universal quantifier (for all)
Sometimes we want to say something about all objects in a set. We can use quantifier predicates to do this. For example, are all animals in the set mammals? We use the _universal quantifier_:

$$\forall_{a\in A}\text{mammal}(a)$$

You can read this as `does it hold for all objects $$a$$ in $$A$$ that $$a$$ is a mammal?' We implicitly introduced a function $$\text{mammal}:A\rightarrow\{\top,\bot\}$$ with $$\text{mammal}(a)=\top$$ if $$a$$ is a mammal or $$\bot$$ otherwise.

## Existential quantifier (exists)
Another type of question we can ask is, for example, is there someone I know that I like? We use the _existential quantifier_:

$$\exists_{p\in F_{me}}\left[\text{like}(p)>0\right]$$

Which we can read as `does there exist a person $$p$$ in the set of my friends $$F_{me}$$ for which I like them $$\text{like}(p)>0$$?'
