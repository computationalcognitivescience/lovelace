## About the authors
[Mark Blokpoel](http://www.markblokpoel.com) is a computer scientist and computational cognitive scientist. [Iris van Rooij](irisvanrooijcogsci.com) is a psychologist and cognitive scientist. Both authors are based at Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University. Parts of this book were written while Van Rooij was at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences ([NIAS](https://nias.knaw.nl)). Van Rooij and Blokpoel previously co-authored [Cognition and Intractability](https://cognitionandintractability.com) with Johan Kwisthout and Todd Wareham.

## Acknowledgements
We have learned a lot from participants in courses and workshops that we taught on the topic over the last 10 years. We would like to thank them all. This includes hundreds of BSc Artificial Intelligence students and dozens of Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, and Computer Science BSc, MSc and PhD students who have taken the Computational & Formal Modeling course at Radboud University. It also includes PhD students at the [Behavioural Science Institute](https://www.ru.nl/bsi/), staff at the Dept. of Social Psychology at Radboud University, and members of the [Experimental Psychopathology and Affective Neuroscience (EPAN)](https://www.epanlab.nl) research group at the Donders Institute who participated in workshops that we organized on the topic of this book.
