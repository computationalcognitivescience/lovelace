We pick up the conversation between Verbal and Formal from [Chapter 4 - Subset Choice](/lovelace/part_ii/subset#dialogue-1-formalizing-inviting-guests). Formal is very excited to share the computer simulations they implemented of the theoretical models Formal and Verbal created. Formal has some suggestions on how to use the simulations, which they explain to Verbal.

{% indent 4 %}
**Formal:** Welcome dr. Verbal! As promised, I have implemented computer simulations for three of our computational-level models.
{% endindent %}

{% indent 0 %}
**Verbal:** That's great. You said we can use the simulations to explore the models' empirical implications. How does that work?
{% endindent %}

{% indent 4 %}
**Formal:** The three formal models each make different tradeofs in optimizing selecting guests...
{% endindent %}

{% indent 0 %}
**Verbal:** Yes, I remember. Shall I run some experiments to see which one is best?
{% endindent %}

{% indent 4 %}
**Formal:** ...wait! Before you leave me alone again for a few months, let's do a bit more theory before the test. Do we even know if the models are different in important and meaningful ways? Even if they are different, are they so under sensible conditions?
{% endindent %}

{% indent 0 %}
**Verbal:** But the formalisations are different, so the models must behave differently, right?
{% endindent %}

{% indent 4 %}
**Formal:**
While the formalizations are different, it might be actually be possible that they behave the same or very similarly. Sometimes we can formally derive equivalence, but this is not always possible.{% sidenote 'sn-id-equivalence' 'You can read about mathematically proving model equivalence in [Chapter 5 - Coherence](/lovelace/part_ii/coherence#Equivalence).' %} In those cases, we can use computer simulations to explore the qualitative differences between theories.
{% endindent %}

{% indent 0 %}
**Verbal:** Ah, I would like to know if there are qualitative differences between the theories. I guess we can possibly rule out theories or find ways to update them, just like when we were formalizing my verbal theories.
{% endindent %}

{% indent 4 %}
**Formal:** Indeed, that is the idea.
{% endindent %}

If you jumped here directly from [Chapter 4 - Subset choice](/lovelace/part_ii/subset)
you may find it helpful to first read [Chapter 9 - Scala and mathlib](/lovelace/part_ii/mathlib) to learn how to read (and write) Scala code using the ```mathlib``` library. In addition to the default ```mathlib``` library, the simulation code on this page includes supporting code which we explain first.

## Supporting code
Running simulations requires input instances as specified by the theoretical model. While we could code input by hand, that is a lot of work. The beauty of using computer simulations is that it can do the hard work for us by *automatically* generating input. To that end, Formal has written a supporting code. {% sidenote 'sn-id-helper' 'Supporting code is often written specifically for a domain. For example, [simulating Coherence](/lovelace/part_iii/sim_coherence) uses different support code.' %}

For now, it is not important that you know how to write support code. However, in order to explore and adapt the code that Formal has provided, being able to *use* support code is recommended. Let's explore some examples. Remember that you can run (and adapt) the code in your browser using the <button style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.6) !important;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) !important;border-radius: 5px;border: 1px solid #ddd;font-family: Lato,'Helvetica Neue',Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 14px;
padding: 3px 8px;transition: all 350ms ease;"><img src="https://embed.scalafiddle.io/runicon.png" style="padding: 0;margin: 0 0 4px 0;vertical-align: middle;width: 16px;height: 16px;display: inline;">Run</button> button.

The theoretical models for selecting invitees (subset choice) take as input sets of persons and a function that for pairs of persons returns if they like eachother or not. The support code helps us generate these parts of the input.

### Persons
A particular person is identified by their name, and can be defined by using ```Person(name: String)```. This function takes a string as input and returns a Person object with the given name:

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" %}
```scala
Person("Jamie")
```
{% endscalafiddle %}

Persons with the same name are considered to refer to the same individual, since the computer cannot distinguish between them.

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" %}
```scala
val person1 = Person("Jamie")
val person2 = Person("Jamie")

person1 == person2
```
{% endscalafiddle %}

We can also create random persons. Their names are randomly selected from a predefined list with 100 names. Running the code below multiple times will create different persons.

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" %}
```scala
Person.random
```
{% endscalafiddle %}

We can also generate groups of ```n``` random individuals.

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" %}
```scala
Person.randomGroup(5)
```
{% endscalafiddle %}

These functions will help us create sets of persons. We can then use ```mathlib``` to work with these sets as expected. For example, we can create a set of random persons who are liked $$L$$, a set of persons who are disliked $$D$$, and the set of all persons $$P=L\cup D$$:  

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" %}
```scala
val persons = Person.randomGroup(5)
val personsLiked = persons.take(2)
val personsDisliked = persons /\ personsLiked

println(personsLiked)
println(personsDisliked)
println(persons)
```
{% endscalafiddle %}

### Like-function
The final support code Formal provided is used to create like relationships between persons. In the formal model this function is defined as $$like: P\times P \rightarrow \{true,false\}$$. After discussing with a colleague (see [Exercise X in Chapter 4](/lovelace/part_ii/subset#try-again)), Formal recognized that the like function was intended to exclude reflection (i.e., self-liking) and is symmetrical $$like(a,b)=like(b,a)$$ (i.e., it formalises like or dislike *eachother*).{% sidenote 'sn-id-helper' 'The formalisations in this chapter are updated with these properties.' %}

One could specify a like relationship manually. Simply create persons, store them in values so we can refer to them and then use ```likes``` or ```dislikes``` to create like relationships.

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" %}
```scala
val lela = Person("Lela")
val carlos = Person("Carlos")
val ervin = Person("Ervin")

println(lela likes carlos)
println(carlos dislikes ervin)
println(carlos dislikes lela)
```
{% endscalafiddle %}

Specifying a *complete* like function for a set of persons, however, will be quite a chore: for each pair you need to explicate if $$a$$ likes $$b$$ and vice versa. For $$10$$ persons, that is a list of $$10 \cdot 10=100$$ likes. Support functions help us reduce this chore.

When given a partial specification of the like function, we can complete it by assuming that any non-specified relationship is a dislike. Use the support function ```.deriveLikeFunction(partialLikes: Set[Likes])``` on a set of persons to create a like function for which the domain consists of all pairs of persons (including $$(a,b)$$, $$(b,a)$$ and $$a,a$$). It will complete ```partialLikes``` by assuming non-specified relationships are dislikes.

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" layout="v50" %}
```scala
val lela = Person("Lela")
val carlos = Person("Carlos")
val ervin = Person("Ervin")

val persons = Set(lela, carlos, ervin)
val partialLikings = Set(lela likes carlos, carlos likes ervin,carlos dislikes lela)

def like = persons.deriveLikeFunction(partialLikings)
```
The ```Viz.render()``` function can draw graphs specified in the [DOT language](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html). The ```.toDotString(like)``` helper function transforms persons and a like function to graph figures.
```scala
Viz.render(persons.toDotString(like))
```
And we can view the truth values associated with all pairs of persons.
```scala
List(
  like(lela, carlos),
  like(lela, ervin),
  like(carlos, ervin)
)
```
{% endscalafiddle %}

While this approach is useful to manually explore small examples, it still is a lot of manual work. Wouldn't it be nice if we can generate a complete like function randomly? Use the support function ```.randomLikeFunction(probability: Double)``` on a set of persons to create a random like function. For each pair (including $$(a,b)$$, $$(b,a)$$ and $$a,a$$), it generates ```true``` with probability equal to the ratio or false otherwise.

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" layout="v50" minheight="700"%}
```scala
val lela = Person("Lela")
val carlos = Person("Carlos")
val ervin = Person("Ervin")

val persons = Set(lela, carlos, ervin)

def like = persons.randomLikeFunction(0.7)

Viz.render(persons.toDotString(like))

List(
  like(lela, carlos),
  like(lela, ervin),
  like(carlos, ervin)
)
```
{% endscalafiddle %}

{% question %}
What happens to the output of the like function when you change the probability?
{% hidden Hint? %}
Try changing the probability value (the input of the function ```randomLikeFunction```) and see what changes in the output.
{% endhidden %}
{% endquestion %}

A final example to illustrate how to generate a random input instance. An alternative visualization is used to indicate which persons are liked by the host or not. Note that generating a visualization graph with many persons will not display properly or potentially crash your browser due to the many relationships.

{% scalafiddle template="mathlib" layout="v20" minheight="700"%}
```scala
val persons = Person.randomGroup(5)
val personsLiked = persons.take(2)
val personsDisliked = persons \ personsLiked

def like = persons.randomLikeFunction(0.7)

Viz.render(persons.toDotString(personsLiked, personsDisliked, like))
```
{% endscalafiddle %}


{% question %}
With these support functions, we can randomly create instances for the formal models of selecting invitees. Why is this helpful?
{% hidden Hint? %}
It save a lot of manual work.

{% question %}
Can you think of another use?
{% hidden Hint? %}
You can compare model behaviour for the same input.

{% question %}
Can you think of another use?
{% hidden Hint? %}
You can generate different inputs at random and see if (and how) model behaviour changes as a function of the input.

{% question %}
Can you think of another use?
{% endquestion %}
{% endhidden %}
{% endquestion %}
{% endhidden %}
{% endquestion %}
{% endhidden %}

## Simulating <span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: normal;">Selecting Invitees</span>

In this section we simulate {% problem Selecting invitees (version 4, 5 and 6) %}. Each of the models is copied here, for your convenience. To make the code more readable, we use names in the code that are more descriptive than the single letters used in math (see Table 1).


{% marginnote 'Table-ID1' 'Table 1: the mapping from math notation to Scala code.'  %}
<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block" style="margin-top:3rem;">

| Math | Scala | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $$P$$ | ```persons``` | Set of persons from which to select invitees. |
| $$L$$ | ```personsLiked``` | Subset of persons that is liked. |
| $$D$$ | ```personsDisliked``` | Subset of persons that is disliked. |
| $$like$$ | ```like``` | Function that captures if two persons like each other or not. |
| $$k$$ | ```k``` | Value that states how many of the invited persons at most can be disliked. |
| $$G$$ | ```invitees``` | Set of invited persons. |
| $$X$$ | ```x``` | Set of all unique pairs of persons that like each other. |
| $$Y$$ | ```y``` | Set of all unique pairs of persons that dislike each other. |

</div>

From here on, you are free to explore the simulations at your own. Try to get a feeling for how the three formalizations behave. You can even change the simulation code if you want. After simulating the three models individually, we provide a sandbox for you to compare their behaviour directly.
